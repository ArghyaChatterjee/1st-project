# Snake-Game-In-html
This is a simple snake game running on local server. It's written in html. 
You just need to have a browser(chrome is preferable), a text editor where you can edit the text (visual studio is preferable)
and just go for it and have the courage to run the programme.
That's all you need.
Good luck & go for it.
